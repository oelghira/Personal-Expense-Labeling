# Personal-Expense-Labeling
In this project I show the process of how I have created and tested a model to categorize my personal expenses for my budget. The model is 92% accurate in categorizing my expenses. I've accomplished this by using TF-IDF to quantify the descriptions from my credit card and bank account exports and categorize new expenses by using cosine similarity to label new expenses each month.
